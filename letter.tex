Dear Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Typescript Engineer role at Supertab, where I can leverage my expertise in buiding application and software engineering to help customers.

% With over 8 years of experience as a Fullstack Engineer, I've developed a strong foundation in developing and integrating microservices using JavaScript, Java, and industry-leading frameworks. My proficiency in cloud-based infrastructure, including AWS, GCP, and serverless technologies, enables me to drive business agility and efficiency. 

% As I reflect on my career journey, I realize that my passion for software engineering, combined with my experience working with cross-functional teams, has led me to become a problem solver with a strong technical background. My achievements in improving codebase health, optimizing API specifications, and delivering value have not only enhanced my skills but also given me a unique perspective on what makes a successful team dynamic.

% I'm particularly drawn to this role because I believe that my blend of technical expertise, problem-solving skills make me a good fit for this position. My strong understanding of cloud-based infrastructure, combined with my ability to drive system performance improvements, would enable me to effectively resolve critical production issues.

I am a software developer with more than 8 years of experience. My focus is on building products based on web
technologies. I am used to working on things that are outside my current area of expertise so I often have to acquire the
necessary knowledge in a short period of time. I’m quite flexible with technologies and have gained a lot of experience
working in different areas.

My main strength lay in frontend field developing web application with react ecosystem. But I also have solid production
experience working with backend, cloud infrastructure, on‐premises orchestration solution. My previous experience
has given me a solid technical background, understanding of software development processes and communication
skills. In my current position, I have worked with a variety of projects and domains with and without team members.
I’ve held key developer positions and delivered several products to the MVP/first customer stage. In my previous project, besides from frontend responsibilities, I was also tasked to implement backend functionality using the same tech stack as in the job listing: pydantic, sqlalchemy, fastapi, postgresql. I also pushed for better management of api specification (openapi schema).

As an employee of a large software engineering services company, I want to continue to challenge myself and work on
great products with long‐term ownership over product or codebase.

% With its commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction, I believe that SAP's values align with my own passion for delivering high-quality solutions. I'm excited about the prospect of joining a team that shares my enthusiasm for software engineering and collaboration.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I looking forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Sincerely,

\theauthor
